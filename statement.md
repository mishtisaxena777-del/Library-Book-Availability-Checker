Library Book Availability Checker
>Problem Statement

Libraries face challenges providing quick and efficient methods for users to check if a book is available. Manual verification of book status by library staff is time-consuming, error-prone, and inconvenient for users. Especially with large collections, users waste time searching or inquiring repeatedly about book availability. This project addresses the need for instant, automated verification of the availability of books by ISBN, reducing manual effort and increasing user satisfaction.

>Scope of the Project

The system focuses on verifying book availability in a library collection using ISBN as the unique key. It stores book metadata such as title, author, and availability status in a dictionary for rapid lookup. The project is intended as a simple, console-based application that provides immediate feedback on book status. It does not handle borrowing, returning, user management, or persistent data storage, but it provides a foundation for adding such features later.
