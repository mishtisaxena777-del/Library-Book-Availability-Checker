The Library Book Availability Checker is a simple Python application designed to help users quickly verify if a book is available in a library by entering its ISBN number. The project uses Python dictionaries to store book details with efficient lookup capabilities. Users can input the ISBN via the console and receive instant feedback on the book's availability status.

>Installation & Running Instructions

Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your machine.

Copy the project code into a file named library_checker.py.

Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the file.

Run the program using the command:

>Instructions for Testing

Test the program by running it and inputting different ISBNs present in the books dictionary to see their availability status.
